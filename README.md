# MammogrAID

MammogrAID provides an agentic aid to mammogram diagnosis.

## Description

MammogrAID streamlines the diagnosis by providing an accurate classification of an uploaded Mammogram as either "Benign" or "Cancerous", utilizing the CBIS-DDSM-CNN. This allows for the user to go about the next step by narrowing down the tumor classification to the stage of the tumor, removing an entire stage out of the diagnosis process.
